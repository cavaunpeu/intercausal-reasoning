An example of intercausal reasoning in Bayesian networks using both point estimates and simulated data.

This work asks two probabilistic questions of a toy network. First, it offers distributional estimates given Bayesian models of the observed data. Second, it offers algebraic solutions given point estimates of the true component probabilities.
